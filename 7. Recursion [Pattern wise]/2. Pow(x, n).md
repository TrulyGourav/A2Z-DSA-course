# 🔢 50. Pow(x, n)

## 📝 Problem Statement

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., `x^n`).

---

## 🌟 Intuition (💡 Highlighted)

The brute-force method of multiplying `x` by itself `n` times is too slow when `n` is very large.  
We observe a **repeated pattern** based on **exponentiation by squaring**:

- Instead of computing `x^n` by multiplying `x` `n` times,
- We divide the problem into halves:  
  - If `n` is even, then `x^n = (x^(n/2))^2`
  - If `n` is odd, then `x^n = x * (x^(n//2))^2`
- This significantly reduces the number of multiplications: **from O(n) to O(log n)**.

## 🪜 Approach

1. Convert `n` to a long value to handle `Integer.MIN_VALUE` safely.
2. If `n < 0`, flip the sign and compute the reciprocal: `x = 1 / x` and `n = -n`.
3. Use **iterative exponentiation by squaring**:
   - Multiply `answer` only when the current bit is set (`n % 2 == 1`).
   - Square `x` at each step.
   - Divide `n` by 2 until it becomes zero.

## 🧠 Conceptual Understanding

- This is a **divide-and-conquer** strategy applied to exponentiation.
- Uses **bit manipulation** implicitly via even/odd checks and halving.
- Recognize this as the **Exponentiation by Squaring** pattern – **widely used in cryptography, modular arithmetic, etc.**

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` — Because we divide `n` by 2 at every step.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — Only constant space is used.

## 💻 Code Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        long N = n;
        if (N < 0) {
            x = 1 / x;
            N = -N;
        }
        double answer = 1;
        double currentProduct = x;
        for (long i = N; i > 0; i /= 2) {
            if (i % 2 == 1) {
                answer = answer * currentProduct;
            }
            currentProduct *= currentProduct;
        }
        return answer;
    }
}

```

## 🔄 Other Possible Approaches (No Code)
1. Recursive Exponentiation by Squaring
Use recursion instead of iteration.

- Time: O(log n)
- Space: O(log n) (due to recursive call stack)

2. Brute-force Multiplication
Multiply x by itself n times.

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
Not suitable for large n.

## 🧠 Pattern Recognition Tips
Whenever you see power (or similar to x^n), think about:

- Even/Odd exponent logic
- Recursive or iterative squaring

The same pattern can be extended to:

- modular exponentiation (x^n % m)
- matrix exponentiation
- fast Fibonacci calculations
