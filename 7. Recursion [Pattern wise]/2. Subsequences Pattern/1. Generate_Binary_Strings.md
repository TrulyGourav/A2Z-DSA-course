# 🚀 Generate Binary Strings Without Consecutive 1s

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return all binary strings of length `n` that **do not contain consecutive `1`s**. Return the result in **lexicographically increasing order**.

A binary string is a string consisting only of characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

---

### 🔍 Examples

**Input:** `n = 3`  
**Output:** `["000", "001", "010", "100", "101"]`

**Input:** `n = 2`  
**Output:** `["00", "01", "10"]`

---

## 💡 Intuition

👉 **The key insight:**  
We can **only place a '1' if the previous character was not a '1'**. This avoids consecutive 1s.

So the problem boils down to a **recursive backtracking** process where:
- `'0'` can be added freely at any position.
- `'1'` can be added **only when the previous character is `'0'`**.

Lexicographical order is naturally preserved by **always adding `'0'` first**, then `'1'`.

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Understanding

- This is a classic example of a **Constraint-Based Backtracking** problem.
- We're building the binary string **character by character**.
- At each step, our decision depends on the **previous character** (to enforce "no consecutive 1s").

🧩 This problem also highlights the power of:
- **State tracking** (tracking `prevChar`)
- **Pruning recursion tree** based on rules

---

## 🧭 Approach

1. Start with an empty string.
2. At every recursive call:
   - Always try to add `'0'`.
   - Add `'1'` **only if the previous character is not `'1'`**.
3. Once the string length becomes `n`, add it to the result list.
4. Ensure `'0'` is explored before `'1'` to maintain **lexicographical order**.

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(2^n)` in the worst case (if all combinations are allowed), but **less than 2^n** due to constraint pruning.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - Recursion stack: `O(n)`  
  - Result list: depends on output size — **up to Fibonacci(n+2)** strings (like in count of binary strings without consecutive 1s)

## 🧾 Code Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> generateBinaryStrings(int n) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        generateStrings(n, "", result, '0'); // Start with '0' as a safe previous character
        return result;
    }

    private void generateStrings(int n, String current, List<String> result, char prevChar) {
        if (current.length() == n) {
            result.add(current);
            return;
        }

        // Always allowed to add '0'
        generateStrings(n, current + "0", result, '0');

        // Add '1' only if previous character is not '1'
        if (prevChar != '1') {
            generateStrings(n, current + "1", result, '1');
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Interview Tip to Remember This Logic

**"Treat it like traffic signals!" 🚦**

Think of `'1'` as a **red light** — you need a **green (0)** before you can go (add `'1'` again).

➡️ Just like **you never get two red lights back-to-back**, you never get `'11'`.

So while building the string:
- `'0'` is always a green light.
- `'1'` is red, and can’t be placed after another `'1'`.

🧠 **Mnemonic:**  
> "**Only a green light (0) can allow a red (1)**. Two reds in a row? Crash! 💥"

Use this traffic signal analogy whenever you're building binary strings with rules. You'll never forget this logic again.
