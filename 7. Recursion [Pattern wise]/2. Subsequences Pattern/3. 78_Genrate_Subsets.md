# 78. Subsets 🔢🔁

### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of **unique elements**, return **all possible subsets** (the power set).

The solution set **must not contain duplicate subsets**. Return the solution in any order.

---

### 🧪 Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input:  nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[], [1], [2], [1,2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input:  nums = [0]
Output: [[], [0]]
```

---

### ✅ Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**

---

## 🧠 Intuition (💡 Highlighted)
Think of each number — **include it** in the subset or **exclude it**. This gives **2 choices for every element**, which leads to **2^n subsets** (power set).  
Recursively make a decision at each index to either include the current element or not.

> This is a classic **backtracking/decision-tree** problem. Think of a binary tree, where **each node branches based on decision: pick or skip**.

---

## 🧩 Conceptual Understanding

Imagine traversing a decision tree:

- At each level, you decide:
  - ✅ include the current element.
  - ❌ skip the current element.
- Recursively build subsets as you go.
- Use a temporary list to hold current elements.
- Add to result when you've processed all elements.

## 🌳 Recursion Tree (For `nums = [1, 2]`)  

```
                          []
                       /     \
                   [1]       []
                 /     \    /   \
            [1,2]    [1]  [2]   []
```

- Start from `[]`
- First include 1 → go to `[1]`
- From `[1]` → include 2 → `[1,2]`
- From `[1]` → skip 2 → `[1]`
- Backtrack and try skipping 1 → now start from `[]`
- From `[]` → include 2 → `[2]`
- From `[]` → skip 2 → `[]`

## 🧾 Java Code – Recursive (Backtracking)

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(0, nums, new ArrayList<>(), result);
        return result;
    }

    private void backtrack(int index, int[] nums, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(current)); // Add current subset

        for (int i = index; i < nums.length; i++) {
            current.add(nums[i]); // choose
            backtrack(i + 1, nums, current, result); // explore
            current.remove(current.size() - 1); // un-choose (backtrack)
        }
    }
}
```

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric            | Complexity            |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Time Complexity   | `O(2^n * n)`           |
| Space Complexity  | `O(n)` (auxiliary stack) + result |

- `2^n` subsets generated
- each subset may take up to `O(n)` time to copy
- recursion depth is `O(n)`

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Brute Force using Bits     | Loop from `0` to `2^n - 1`, use bitmask to decide which elements to include                     | `O(2^n * n)`                         |
| Recursive Backtracking     | Include/Exclude each element recursively                                                         | `O(2^n * n)` ✅ **(Current Approach)**|
| Iterative                  | Start with [[]], then for each element, add it to all existing subsets                          | `O(2^n * n)`                         |

## 🧠 Pattern Recognition
- Belongs to the **Decision Tree** family.
- Also known as the **"Include/Exclude" pattern**.
- This structure is widely reused in:
  - Generating combinations/permutations.
  - Solving subset sum and partition problems.
  - Bitmask-based problems.

## 🧠 Memory Tip (🔥 Never Forget Trick)

> **"Each element asks a question: Should I join or not?"**
>
> That’s it. Just say “yes” or “no” to each element—**like a friend asking to join a group photo** 😄📸  
> All possible combinations of these yes/no answers = power set!

So, whenever you see subsets or power set problems, remember:
> **Every element branches the path into 2 — include or exclude.**
