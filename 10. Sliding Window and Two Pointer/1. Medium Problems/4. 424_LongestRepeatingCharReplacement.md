## 📘 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

### 🔗 Problem Link
[LeetCode - Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can **replace at most `k` characters** in `s` with **any uppercase English letter**.  

Return the **length of the longest substring** that contains the **same letter after at most `k` replacements**.

---

### 📌 Examples

**Example 1**
```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with 'B's or vice versa → "BBBB" or "AAAA"
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Replace the middle 'A' with 'B' → "AABBBBA" → longest: "BBBB"
```

## 🧠 Intuition (🌟 Must Read)

> 🔑 **At any moment, the only thing stopping a window from being valid is that some characters are not the majority. So if we know the count of the most frequent character in the window, and the rest are less than or equal to `k`, we can fix the rest.**

- Think: **How many characters do I need to change to make all characters in this window the same?**
- Answer: **Window size - maxFreqCharCount**  
- If that number > k → too many changes needed → shrink window

---

## 🎯 Approach: Sliding Window

We use a **sliding window** `[left, right]`:
- Expand `right` one step at a time
- Track frequency of each character
- If `window size - maxFreq` > k → too many changes → shrink from `left`
- Track the maximum window length at each step

---

### 🔍 Conceptual Understanding

**Assume "valid" means:** We can change ≤ `k` characters to make the window all the same character.  
We **track frequency** of characters and always try to keep the window **valid**.

Let:
- `maxFreq` = highest frequency character in the current window
- `window size = right - left + 1`

**Key check:**
```java
windowSize - maxFreq > k → shrink from left
```

### 🧮 Time & Space Complexity

| Complexity | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| ⏱️ Time    | O(N) — Each character is visited at most twice (once by right, once by left) |
| 🧠 Space   | O(26) = O(1) — Fixed-size map of 26 uppercase characters |

---

## 🌲 Recursion/Sliding Window Tree (for conceptual clarity)

For string `"AABABBA"`, `k = 1`  
Consider moving `right` from 0 → 6:

```
Window: [0,3] = "AABA" → Most frequent = A(3), Window size = 4 → 4 - 3 = 1 ≤ k ✅ → maxLen = 4
Window: [1,4] = "ABAB" → freq A=2, B=2 → 4-2 = 2 > k ❌ → shrink left → [2,4]
Window: [2,5] = "BABB" → freq B=3, A=1 → 4-3 = 1 ≤ k ✅ → maxLen = 4
Window: [3,6] = "ABBA" → freq B=2, A=2 → 4-2 = 2 > k ❌ → shrink
```

---

## ✅ Code (Sliding Window)

```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int[] freq = new int[26]; // Frequency of letters
        int maxCount = 0; // Max frequency of any char in current window
        int left = 0, maxLength = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(right);
            freq[ch - 'A']++;
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, freq[ch - 'A']);

            // Total letters to change = (window size - maxCount)
            if ((right - left + 1) - maxCount > k) {
                freq[s.charAt(left) - 'A']--; // Shrink from left
                left++;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Pattern Recognition

This is a **Sliding Window** + **Character Frequency Tracking** problem.  
Look for this combo when:
- You are allowed to **change/skip/fix at most k elements**
- You’re aiming for **longest subarray/substring**

---

## 📝 Memory Tip (To Never Forget 🔥)

💡 Think of this as "**Fixing the window to make it uniform**":
> “How many characters need to be changed in this window to make it one letter?  
Only worry about the most frequent letter. If others are ≤ k, we’re good.”

**Shortcut Mantra:**  
🧠 *WindowSize - MaxFreq ≤ k → Valid window*
