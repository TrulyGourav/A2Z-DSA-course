## 🧾 Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the **length of the longest substring** without repeating characters.

---

### 🔍 Examples

| Input        | Output | Explanation           |
|--------------|--------|------------------------|
| `"abcabcbb"` | `3`    | `"abc"` is the longest |
| `"bbbbb"`    | `1`    | `"b"` is the longest   |
| `"pwwkew"`   | `3`    | `"wke"` is valid       |

> A **substring** is a contiguous block of characters. `"pwke"` is a subsequence, not a valid substring.

---

## ✅ Constraints
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

---

## 💡 Intuition (🔥 Most Important – Read First!)

To find the longest substring **without repeating characters**, we must **track the characters** we've seen and their **positions** so we don’t include duplicates in the current window.

Here’s the intuition:
- Use a **sliding window** to maintain a window of non-repeating characters.
- If a **duplicate character** is encountered, **slide the window’s left side forward** until the duplicate is removed.
- Keep updating the **maximum length** during this process.

> Imagine walking with two fingers over the string, adjusting only when necessary, and never stepping back.

## 🧠 Conceptual Understanding

### 🔁 Technique Used:
- **Two Pointers + Sliding Window**
- Dynamic window size

### 📦 Data Structure:
- `HashSet` or `HashMap` to track character indices efficiently

## 🧮 Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity    | Value                  |
|---------------|------------------------|
| ⏱️ Time       | `O(n)` — Every character visited at most twice |
| 🧠 Space      | `O(min(n, m))` where `m` is the size of the charset (e.g., 128 for ASCII) |

---

## 🌳 Sliding Window Visualization

Let’s take the test case: `s = "abcabcbb"`

```
Start → "abc" → duplicate at 'a' → slide start pointer
Window adjusts: now it's "bca"
Next duplicate at 'b' → window = "cab"
Continue until "abc" again → longest = 3
```

| Index | Char | Window     | Action                      | MaxLen |
|-------|------|------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| 0     | 'a'  | a          | Add                         | 1      |
| 1     | 'b'  | ab         | Add                         | 2      |
| 2     | 'c'  | abc        | Add                         | 3 ✅   |
| 3     | 'a'  | bca        | Duplicate → Slide Left      | 3      |
| ...   | ...  | ...        | ...                         | 3      |

---

## ✅ Final Code (Sliding Window Approach in Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = 0, maxLen = 0;
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();

        while (right < s.length()) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(right);

            if (!set.contains(currentChar)) {
                set.add(currentChar);
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
                right++;
            } else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

| 🐇 HashMap + Sliding Window    | Store char → index mapping, skip duplicates in one step                    | O(n) | O(n) | ✅ Best (Optimized) |
| 🧰 Array as HashMap (ASCII)     | Fixed-size array instead of HashSet for speed (only for ASCII)             | O(n) | O(1) | ✅ Optimized |
| 🏷️ Two Pointers + HashSet      | Our current solution → adjust left as needed                              | O(n) | O(n) | ☑️ (Current) |

## 🧠 Pattern Recognition

> This belongs to the **Sliding Window + HashSet** pattern:
- "Find the longest/shortest/valid window"
- Use `left` and `right` pointers to maintain window
- HashSet/Map to track window constraints (unique, freq count, etc.)

---

## 📝 Tip to Remember

🧩 **Think of the window like an elastic band**:
- It **expands** (move `right`) until it **snaps** (duplicate found)
- Then **slides forward** (move `left`) to remove pressure (remove duplicate)
- Keep track of the **longest relaxed stretch**

🎯 *Mental Shortcut*:  
> “Slide right to grow, slide left to remove repeats.”

⛳ **Never reset the window** — just shrink it until it's valid again.

---

## 📚 Summary

- **Best technique**: Sliding Window with HashSet
- **Don't restart** window on duplicates — adjust `left` pointer
- Keep updating max length during each expansion
- Recognize this pattern for many "longest substring/window" problems

Happy coding! 🚀
