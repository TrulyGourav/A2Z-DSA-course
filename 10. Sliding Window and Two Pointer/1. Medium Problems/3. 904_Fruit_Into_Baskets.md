# 🍎 Fruit Into Baskets (LeetCode 904 - Medium)

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are given an array `fruits[]` where `fruits[i]` represents the type of fruit on the `i-th` tree (trees are planted in a straight line from left to right).

You have **two baskets**, and each can only hold **one type of fruit** (but **unlimited quantity** of that type).

You can start collecting fruits from **any tree** and must **go only to the right**, picking **exactly one fruit from each tree**.

Once you reach a tree with a fruit type that **can't fit in either of your two baskets**, you must stop collecting.

👉 Return the **maximum number of fruits** you can collect.

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: fruits = [1, 2, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Basket 1 → fruit 1 (tree 0 and 2)
Basket 2 → fruit 2 (tree 1)
Max fruits = 3
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: fruits = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Start at tree 1:
Basket 1 → fruit 2 (tree 1, 3, 4)
Basket 2 → fruit 3 (tree 2)
Max fruits = 4
```

## 🌟 Intuition (Must-Read)

We want to find the **longest contiguous subarray** that contains **at most two distinct elements** (fruit types).

This is a **classic sliding window pattern**:  
> 🧠 Think of it like carrying two bags while walking down the tree path. You can keep adding fruits to them **as long as you don’t exceed two fruit types**.

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Understanding

We're solving a **Longest Substring with at most 2 distinct characters** problem but in array form.

We'll use:
- A **sliding window** (with two pointers) to track the window of fruits
- A **HashMap** to store the count of each fruit in the window

When the number of unique fruits > 2:
- Shrink the window from the left until we are back to only two fruit types

## ⌛ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric        | Complexity     |
|---------------|----------------|
| Time          | O(n)           |
| Space         | O(1) — Max 3 keys in map (bounded) |

## ✅ Code Solution (Sliding Window)

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalFruits(int[] fruits) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int maxFruits = 0;
        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < fruits.length; right++) {
            map.put(fruits[right], map.getOrDefault(fruits[right], 0) + 1);

            while (map.size() > 2) {
                map.put(fruits[left], map.get(fruits[left]) - 1);
                if (map.get(fruits[left]) == 0) {
                    map.remove(fruits[left]);
                }
                left++;
            }

            maxFruits = Math.max(maxFruits, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxFruits;
    }
}
```

## 🌳 Sliding Window Visualization (Small Test Case)

Example: `fruits = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]`

```
Start → [1, 2] → add fruit 1 and 2 ✅
Next → [1, 2, 3] → add fruit 3 ❌ (3rd type)
    Shrink window to [2, 3] → now 2 types again
    Continue → [2, 3, 2], then [3, 2, 2]
Max window: [3, 2, 2] → size 3
Better window → [2, 3, 2, 2] → size 4 ✅
```

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|------------|
| Brute Force           | Try every subarray, track distinct fruits                                   | O(n²)    | O(n)    | ❌         |
| Sliding Window        | Maintain window with ≤ 2 types of fruits using a map                        | O(n)     | O(1)    | ✅ ✔       |
| Two Pointers + Count  | Same as sliding window but without hashmap (manual count tracking)          | O(n)     | O(1)    | ✅ (alt)   |

## 💡 Memorization Tip

> "🍓 Just Two Baskets – Slide Until You Drop!"

Visualize walking with **two shopping baskets** through a fruit market (array).  
You can only hold **2 types of fruits**, and once someone offers a 3rd type –  
You panic and **drop** from the front (left pointer) until you’re back to carrying **only two**.

Think of it like:
```txt
🧺🧺 ← only two allowed  
🥭🍏🍊🍏🍏 → Add as long as within 2 types  
Remove 🥭 when 🍊 is added
```

**Mental Hook**: "Whenever I can't carry more types, I shift left until I can."

---

🛠 **Build this sliding window intuition strongly**, as it applies to many problems involving subarrays or substrings with constraints.
