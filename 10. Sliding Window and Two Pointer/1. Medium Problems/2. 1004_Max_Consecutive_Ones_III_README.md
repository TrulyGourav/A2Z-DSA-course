## 🧾 Problem Statement

You are given a **binary array** `nums` and an integer `k`.  
Return the **maximum number of consecutive 1's** in the array **if you can flip at most `k` 0's**.

### 🧪 Examples

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2  
Output: 6  
Explanation: Flip 2 zeros → [1,1,1,0,0,**1**,1,1,1,1,1]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3  
Output: 10  
Explanation: Flip 3 zeros → Longest 1’s window is of size 10
```

## 💡 Intuition (🔥 Most Important)

We want to find the **longest window/subarray** which has **at most `k` 0s**, and the rest 1s.

The key observation:
> We can always expand the window until the number of zeros exceeds `k`, then shrink from the left.

So, we keep a **window** with:
- `left`: start of the window  
- `right`: end of the window  
- `zeroCount`: number of 0s in the current window

Whenever `zeroCount > k`, we shrink the window from the left until it’s valid again.

🧠 **We never reset, we just slide — hence it's a classic Sliding Window.**

## 🧱 Conceptual Understanding

| Term          | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| Sliding Window | We slide a range `[left...right]` maintaining the validity (<= k zeros) |
| Flipping 0's  | Only allowed up to `k` times, so we "track" zeros in the window |
| Shrink window | If 0s > k, move `left` pointer until the condition is met again |

---

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| Time      | `O(n)` – each element is visited at most twice |
| Space     | `O(1)` – no extra space |

---

## 🌳 Visualizing the Sliding Window

Consider `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2`

```
Initial:      [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]
              ↑
             left
                ↑
              right

Progress:     [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]
                         ↑       ↑
                        left    right
    Number of 0s in window > 2 → shrink from left
    Final window: length = 6 → answer = 6
```

---

## ✅ Code (Sliding Window Approach - Final)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, maxLen = 0, zeroCount = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) zeroCount++;

            while (zeroCount > k) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) zeroCount--;
                left++;
            }

            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

## 🧵 Other Approaches

| Approach            | Time | Space | Description |
|---------------------|------|-------|-------------|
| Brute Force         | O(n²) | O(1) | Try every subarray, flip k 0's, count 1s |
| Prefix Sum + Binary Search | O(n log n) | O(n) | Not intuitive here |
| Sliding Window (**this**) | O(n) | O(1) | Most optimal and intuitive ✔️ |

## 🧠 Pattern Recognition

This is part of the **"Longest Subarray with At Most K Bad Elements"** pattern.  
Once you learn this trick, it works for:
- Longest substring with at most K distinct characters
- Longest substring with at most K replacements

---

## 🧠 Memory Tip (Never Forget This!)

> "**When you can flip K bad things to make a good window... just grow the window until you can't, then slide the start!**"

🎯 Say this aloud:
```
🗣️ Expand window while valid → If invalid → Slide left
```

Or even shorter:
```
Grow → Break → Slide → Grow again
```

Visual cue: Think of a **window with glass cracks (0s)** — you’re allowed **K cracks** before needing to move to a new pane.

---

## ✍️ Notes
- You don't *actually* flip anything. Just **imagine** the 0s being flipped, and keep count of how many 0s exist in your window.
- This is a **pattern-reuse problem**. Master it once, and reuse in dozens of string/array questions.
