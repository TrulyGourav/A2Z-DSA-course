# 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum (Medium)

## 🧾 Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the number of **non-empty subarrays** with a sum equal to `goal`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of an array.

---

### 🔍 Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2  
Output: 4  
Explanation: The 4 valid subarrays with sum = 2 are:  
[1,0,1], [0,1,0,1], [1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,0,1]
```

### 🔍 Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0  
Output: 15  
```

## 🌟 Intuition (🔥 Must-Read)

When solving subarray problems with specific **sums**, **prefix sum** with a hash map is a powerful technique.

- You traverse the array once.
- At every index, you track the **cumulative sum (prefix)**.
- You check **how many previous prefixes** were `prefix - goal`, because that means there's a subarray ending at the current index that sums to `goal`.

> "You're counting how many ways you can reach a certain sum up to this point."

Think of it as:
> “How many times have I seen a sum that would make my current prefix – goal? That’s how many valid subarrays end here.”

---

## 📘 Conceptual Understanding

Let’s say:
- `prefix` is the sum from the beginning up to the current index.
- `prefix - goal` must be some prefix we’ve already seen before.
- So we **store frequency** of each prefix sum in a map (`count`).
- Every time we see the same `prefix`, we increase its frequency.

### 🧠 Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| ⏱️ Time       | O(n)  |
| 🗂️ Space      | O(n)  (worst case if all prefix sums are unique) |

## 🌳 Prefix Sum Tree (With Small Test Case)

Let's walk through a simple example:

```
nums = [1,0,1], goal = 2

Step-by-step:
Index 0: prefix = 1     → No match (1 - 2 = -1) → count = {0:1, 1:1}
Index 1: prefix = 1     → Still no match        → count = {0:1, 1:2}
Index 2: prefix = 2     → Match: prefix-goal = 0 → count[0] = 1 → ans += 1
                        → count = {0:1, 1:2, 2:1}

✅ Only one valid subarray: [1,0,1]
```

---

## ✅ Code (Prefix Sum + HashMap)

```java
class Solution {
  public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {
    int ans = 0;
    int prefix = 0;
    Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    count.put(0, 1);

    for (int num : nums) {
      prefix += num;
      int key = prefix - goal;
      if (count.containsKey(key))
        ans += count.get(key);
      count.merge(prefix, 1, Integer::sum);
    }

    return ans;
  }
}
```

## 🧵 Other Approaches

| Approach | Description | Time | Space | Mark |
|---------|-------------|------|-------|------|
| Brute Force | Generate all subarrays and count sum | O(n²) | O(1) | ❌ |
| Sliding Window (only for goal > 0) | Count subarrays with sum ≤ goal and ≤ goal-1, then subtract | O(n) | O(1) | ❌ |
| Prefix Sum + HashMap | Count how many times `prefix - goal` has appeared | O(n) | O(n) | ✅ (Current) |

## 🧩 Pattern Recognition

- Works well for **binary arrays** (0/1) or small integer ranges.
- When you need **count of subarrays with fixed sum**, always think of **prefix sum + hashmap** first.
- Very effective when subarray must be **contiguous**.

---

## 🧠 Never Forget Tip 💡

> Think of it as **building a prefix sum timeline** where you're saying:

**"How many times in the past have I seen a sum such that if I subtract it from my current sum, I get the goal?"**

🔁 Repetition builds confidence.  
Whenever you face **"number of subarrays with sum X"**, immediately reach for:
- Prefix sum
- HashMap of counts
- `prefix - goal` → lookup in map

> Remember the mantra:  
**"Prefix - Goal = Desired Past State"** 🔁 That’s your hit!
