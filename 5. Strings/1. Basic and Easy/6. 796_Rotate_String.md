# 796. Rotate String

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return **true** if and only if `s` can become `goal` after some number of shifts on `s`.

- A **shift** on `s` consists of moving the **leftmost character** of `s` to the **rightmost position**.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase English letters.

## 🌟 Intuition (Key Idea)
If string `goal` is a **rotation** of string `s`, then `goal` must appear as a **substring** inside `s + s`.

👉 Why?  
Because concatenating `s` with itself simulates **all possible rotations**.  
For example:  
```
s = "abcde"
s + s = "abcdeabcde"
All rotations of s = {"abcde", "bcdea", "cdeab", "deabc", "eabcd"}
```
Notice how every rotated version exists inside `s + s`.

So, the check reduces to:
1. Both strings must be of the same length.
2. `goal` should be a substring of `s + s`.

---

## 🔍 Conceptual Understanding
- Rotating a string is equivalent to **circular shifting**.
- Instead of actually rotating step by step (which is costly), we "simulate" rotations in one shot by doubling the string.
- This is a **classic trick** to handle string rotations.

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - Concatenation of `s + s`: **O(n)**  
  - Substring check (`contains`): **O(n²)** in worst case (naïve substring search), but in most modern Java implementations (Boyer-Moore/KMP), it's closer to **O(n)**.  
  👉 So, overall: **O(n²)** worst case.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  - Concatenated string `s + s`: **O(n)**

## 🌳 Recursion / Graph Tree Representation
(Not applicable here directly since it’s a string manipulation problem.)  
But let’s visualize the **rotations** tree for a small example:

```
s = "abc"

          "abc"   (original)
          /   \
     shift1   shift2
       |        |
     "bca" -> "cab"
```

Goal is found if any branch matches `goal`.

---

## 💻 Code (Optimal Solution)
```java
class Solution {
  public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
    return s.length() == goal.length() && (s + s).contains(goal);
  }
}
```

## 🧵 Other Approaches

### 1. **Brute Force (Rotate one by one)**
- For each possible shift (at most `n` times), rotate `s` and check if equals `goal`.
- **Complexity:** O(n²) time, O(n) space.  
- ❌ Not efficient.

### 2. **Using Queue (Simulation)**
- Treat `s` as a queue, pop front and push to back for each shift.
- Check equality at each step.  
- **Complexity:** O(n²).  
- ❌ Similar to brute force, but more structured.

### 3. **KMP (Pattern Matching Algorithm)**
- Instead of `contains`, use KMP to check substring match in `(s + s)`.  
- **Complexity:** O(n).  
- ✅ More optimal but harder to implement.

### 4. **Current Solution (Concatenation + Contains)**
- Concatenate `s + s`, check if `goal` is substring.  
- **Complexity:** O(n²) worst case, but very clean.  
- ✅ This is the **accepted and practical approach**. (✔ Current Solution)

## 🎯 Pattern Recognition
This problem belongs to the **String + Rotation trick** category.  
- If something involves **rotation**, try **concatenation** to simulate all possible shifts.  
- Same trick is used in "Repeated Substring" problems.

## 🧠 Memory Tip
**“Rotation = Double String Trick”** 🔑  
Whenever you see "rotate string" in an interview, immediately think:  
👉 **Double the string → check substring.**  

> 💡 Mental Hack: Imagine wrapping a circular string around itself. The goal string should appear somewhere along the circle if it’s truly a rotation.

✅ With this approach, you’ll **never forget the logic** — just remember:  
**Rotation problems? Concatenate and search.**
