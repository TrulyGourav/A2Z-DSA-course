# 151. Reverse Words in a String

## 📝 Problem Statement
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

The returned string **should only have a single space separating the words** (no extra leading/trailing/multiple spaces).

### Example 1
**Input:**  
```
s = "the sky is blue"
```
**Output:**  
```
"blue is sky the"
```

### Example 2
**Input:**  
```
s = "  hello world  "
```
**Output:**  
```
"world hello"
```

### Example 3
**Input:**  
```
s = "a good   example"
```
**Output:**  
```
"example good a"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.

**Follow-up:** If string type is mutable, solve **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space.

## 🌟 Intuition (Most Important to Remember)
Think of **reading a sentence backwards word-by-word**:
1. **Remove extra noise** (trim leading/trailing/multiple spaces)
2. **Split into words** (like chopping vegetables before rearranging)
3. **Reverse order** (like stacking plates from the end)
4. **Join cleanly** with a single space

👉 This is basically **"clean + split + reverse + join"**.

## 🔍 Conceptual Understanding
- **String trimming** removes extra spaces at the start & end.
- Splitting by `" "` gives words **but also empty strings for multiple spaces**, so we skip those.
- Append from **last word to first**.
- Ensure final output has no trailing space.

## ⏳ Time & Space Complexity
| Step                | Complexity |
|---------------------|------------|
| `trim()`            | O(n)       |
| `split(" ")`        | O(n)       |
| Building result     | O(n)       |
| **Total Time**      | **O(n)**   |
| Extra space (array) | O(n)       |

## 🌳 Visual Representation (Example)

**Example:** `"a good   example"`

```
Step 1: trim()     → "a good   example"
Step 2: split(" ") → ["a", "good", "", "", "example"]
Step 3: reverse    → ["example", "good", "a"]
Step 4: join       → "example good a"
```

## 💻 Code Solution (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    // O(n) time, O(n) space
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split(" ");
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (words[i].length() > 0) { // skip empty strings
                res.append(words[i]);
                res.append(" ");
            }
        }
        
        return res.substring(0, res.length() - 1); // remove last space
    }
}
```

## 🧵 Other Approaches

| Approach | Description | Complexity |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Brute Force** | Traverse string from end, build words manually without split. Keep checking for spaces and append words when completed. | O(n) time, O(n) space |
| **Deque** | Push each word into a deque from left to right, then pop from back to get reversed order. | O(n) time, O(n) space |
| **In-place (Mutable String)** | If `String` mutable (e.g., `char[]`), reverse entire string, then reverse each word individually, while collapsing spaces. | O(n) time, O(1) space |
| **Current Solution ✅** | trim → split → reverse append → join | O(n) time, O(n) space |

## 🎯 Pattern Recognition
- **String manipulation** often follows: *clean → split → process → join*.
- This is a common **Two-Pointer or Reverse Traversal** scenario.
- The follow-up O(1) space version is a **"Reverse whole → Reverse each part"** pattern (classic).

## 🧠 Memory Tip (Never Forget)
Imagine your sentence as **plates stacked in wrong order with dust on them**:
1. First **wipe off dust** (trim spaces)
2. **Stack clean plates** (split words)
3. **Flip the whole stack** (reverse order)
4. **Serve neatly** (join with single space)

Whenever you see "reverse words in string" — think **"Wipe → Stack → Flip → Serve"** 🍽️
